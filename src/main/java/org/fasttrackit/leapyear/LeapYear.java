//Finding a year is a leap or not is a bit tricky. We generally assume that if a year number
// is evenly divisible by 4 is a leap year. But it is not the only case.
// A year is a leap year if âˆ’
//1. It is evenly divisible by 100
//2. If it is divisible by 100, then it should also be divisible by 400
//3. Except this, all other years evenly divisible by 4 are leap years.
